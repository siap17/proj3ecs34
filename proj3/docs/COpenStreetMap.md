The COpenStreetMap class is for reading and processing OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. It parses XML-based OSM files to extract geographic and transit info.

In lines 4-7 we initialize a shared_ptr called InputSource to manage the OSM data source. Additionally, an ExpatParser instance is created to handle XML parsing efficiently.

In lines 9-15 the constructor for COpenStreetMap initializes the InputSource and sets up the ExpatParser with the required callbacks for parsing XML nodes and ways. The InputSource holds the OSM file data, and the parser extracts geographic features.

In lines 17-30 the HandleNode function processes individual nodes from the OSM file. If a node contains latitude and longitude attributes, it is stored in a lookup table for future reference.

If the node represents an intersection or a bus stop, it is tagged accordingly.
Coordinates are stored as a mapping from the node ID.
In lines 32-50 the HandleWay function processes ways (roads, highways, or transit paths) within the OSM data.

It extracts the sequence of nodes forming the way and determines whether the way is a valid street or a restricted access road.
It also stores road connectivity details for efficient route calculation.
In lines 52-70 the class provides methods to access stored street and transit information:

GetIntersection(id): Returns the coordinates of a given intersection.
FindNearestRoad(lat, lon) locates the closest road segment to the specified coordinates.
In lines 72-80 the destructor makes sure that we do proper cleanup of the ExpatParser.

here is some example usage:

    std::shared_ptr<CDataSource> osmSource = std::make_shared<CFileSource>("map.osm");
    COpenStreetMap map(osmSource);
    
    
    auto coords = map.GetIntersection(123456); // get an intersections coordinates
    std::cout << "Intersection at: " << coords.first << ", " << coords.second << std::endl;

this above code loads an OSM file using COpenStreetMap, extracts intersection data, and prints the coordinates.
